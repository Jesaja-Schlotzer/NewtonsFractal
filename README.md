A good explanation con be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RdOwhmqP5s

Examples can be seen in the images folder.
The "size" in the image file names refers to the width and height in pixel of the image and the "iter" refers to the number of iterations made when calcuating the image (The more iterations the more accurate the picture will be).
